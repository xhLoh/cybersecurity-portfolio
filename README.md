# Cybersecurity Portfolio

## About Me
My name is **Loh Xin Herng**. I am a full-time **Software Engineer** and a part-time **Master of Cybersecurity** student.

With a strong foundation in software development, I am transitioning into the security domain to bridge the gap between building applications and securing them. My professional experience in software developing allows me to approach cybersecurity with a practical mindset to focus on how vulnerabilities are introduced during the development lifecycle.

My primary academic interests lie in Penetration Testing, Network and Application Security. I am passionate about understanding secure infrastructures from designing robust network topologies to implementing defense-in-depth strategies against modern threats.
